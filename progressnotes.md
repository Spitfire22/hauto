Worked on index2.html - I didn't like what was going on with index.html so I started from scratch

Left off making 3 images for the top part. 

Items to look into:
- hover effect where the image grows in size and the edges go from rounded to pointed
- finish up the front page look
- header color change ideas where several different 'livery' auto change on reload (kinda a stretch idea)

For Tuesday: 
Finish front page for now,
Work on the car detail page
work on the blog page
