Worked on index2.html - I didn't like what was going on with index.html so I started from scratch

Left off making 3 images for the top part. 

Items to look into:
- finish up the front page look

For Tuesday: 
Finish front page for now,
Work on the car detail page
work on the blog page



Random Ideas:
- footer quote: random Zen footer quote
- rotating theme header with different livery color schemes.

Updated to index3.html - had to fix bugs with the css, 
the only way to accomplish that was to copy/pasta
also new: layout3.css

Brown paper drawing - that's the template.
starting on vehiclechoice.html now
started on vc1.css now
